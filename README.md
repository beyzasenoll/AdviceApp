# Advice App

The **Advice App** is a web-based application designed to recommend weekly content to users based on their areas of interest. Users can select the topics they are interested in, and the app will provide relevant content suggestions for them to consume on a weekly basis.

## Features

- **Personalized Content Recommendations**: Users receive weekly content suggestions based on their selected areas of interest.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: The app is designed with a simple and intuitive interface using Thymeleaf templates.

The **Advice App** is built using a combination of backend, frontend, and database technologies:

### Backend
- **Java Spring Boot**: The core framework used to develop the backend of the application, manage business logic, and serve requests.
- **Spring Boot Thymeleaf**: For server-side rendering of the frontend, allowing dynamic HTML templates to be generated.

### Database
